Blaine is an exceptional ball player no matter where he is on the field or in the line up.  The young man plays hard and gives it 110% every practice and game!  He expects nothing but the best performance from his teammates and himself. He is always there for his teammates to cheer them on or willing to give some helpful tips to possibly improve their skills on the field. On the mound the young man is a beast; there have been multiple times where he is down with a 3 & 0 count and climbs out of the hole for a "K."  He is one of the most determined individuals I have ever met. In Babe Ruth\'s hall of fame speech on June 12, 1939 (kind of fitting) he said "I hope that the coming generation, the young boys today, that they\'ll work hard and also be on it." Blaine has developed as a ball player over the past 3 years and he will always "be on it." His determination to never give up is inspiring.  The assistant coaches (John Ferrante and Dave Hoy) and I wish nothing but the best for Blaine as he keeps treating the game with the respect it deserves and keeps up the fight and always plays hard!', 'photo': 'images/player-profiles/HOTB/2023/HOTB-2023-Blaine-Pourreza.jpg' },

What really clinched it for us in nominating Victor is that since 8u he has always been our leadoff hitter and center fielder.  This season, he struggled in the leadoff spot which caused us to drop him in the order.  He put in countless hours at home working on his swing and with the coaches at practice. Even though he was a little disappointed being moved from leadoff, he didn\'t let that stop him and continued to work hard.  Victor became the spark plug that we needed to jump start the second half of our lineup and our team started to score more runs.  He even pulled me aside after one of our games and asked if he could remain where he is in the lineup.  This is a direct testament to the character that Victor displays day and day out on the baseball field.  Instead of asking what did I do wrong, his hard work, dedication and determination to both himself and his team is producing the results that we all know he is capable of.  It is an absolute pleasure to have Victor as part of this team.  He is well respected by the coaches and more importantly his teammates.  Victor has also grown into a leadership role as well and is always there encouraging his teammates.  This is a well deserved honor.
