Miles has grown as a player by understanding the basic fundamentals of hitting, fielding, throwing, and running as well as a person breaking out of his shy shell, to be a leader amongst his teammates. Miles has a love and passion for baseball. He was always the first to show up for practice and games and encouraged his teammates to pick up a ball and throw with him. Both Coach Moser and Coach Hoy witnessed Miles\' growth with his willingness to play any position and/or bat anywhere in the lineup. He respects the game and plays hard.

I think that sports have really allowed him to come out of his shell as he was initially a very shy and reserved kid. We learned very quickly, that Nicholas had the heart of a lion and he was determined to improve each and every day. As all new players do with adjusting to kid pitch, Nicholas did struggle a bit in the beginning of the year but he didn\'t let that stop him. He persevered, he worked and allowed us to coach him. I wish every team could have 11 or 12 Nicholas Popo\'s on their team, he is all heart and always positive. As a coaching staff, we couldn\'t be proud of the strides that Nicholas has made this year because he always pushed himself to be the best that he could be. All his hard work is now paying off for him as he ascended in the batting order and has become a very consistent pitcher for us at a time when we needed him the most.', "photo": "" },

I\'m the playoffs she took a foul ball to the mask and it shook her. She took a minute got a drink and wiped her tears and went right back to catching.
