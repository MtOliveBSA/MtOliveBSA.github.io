Many young kids get discouraged when they drop a ball, miss a throw, or miss a pitch, but Jackson never loses his smile.  In every game and every practice, Jackson continues to show us that he will "try again" and he is determined to make that play.  Jackson pays close attention to every coaching point, he focuses and tries his best in every drill, and he loves playing baseball. The thing that stands out most about Jackson to me is that at the end of every game or practice, after everyone else goes home, Jackson stays on the field with his dad to keep practicing. He never gives up and I can tell how excited he is to keep learning the sport. The last couple games, other kids including my own son, have chosen to stay and play baseball with him.  Jackson not only has that special determination and positive attitude, but he is spreading his joy in playing baseball.', "photo": '' },
